# Working To-Do List
We're introducing the concept of Document tags to help organize messages / documents generated by AI!


## Views

### Chat
So I really love the tag bubbles at the top of a message. But I think we should use those as AI-generated "tags" to help people organize their docs.

so

* Let's pad the bottom of the message a smidge
* After the timestamp, let's include the performance metrics, subtely.
* Have each message generate tags

### Docs
* Let's actually have a list view, where the title is on the left, the tags in the middle, and the "Saved at" on the right. That feels like a much better way to organize docs.

* Maybe some sort and filter controls at the top
