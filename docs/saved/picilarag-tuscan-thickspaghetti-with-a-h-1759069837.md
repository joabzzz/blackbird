## Pici à la Ragù (Tuscan “thick‑spaghetti” with a hearty meat sauce)

*Pici* (pronounced **PEE-chee**) are the Tuscan answer to thick spaghetti—long, hand‑rolled ribbons of dough that cling perfectly to a rich ragù. This recipe makes enough for **4 – 6 servings** and includes both the pasta and the sauce, so you can experience the full tradition in one go.

## STEP‑BY‑STEP

### 1️⃣ Make the dough  

1. **Combine dry ingredients** – In a bowl, whisk together flour and salt.  
2. **Create a well** – Make a deep well in the centre, crack the eggs into it. Using a fork, beat the eggs lightly, gradually pulling in flour from the edges.  
3. **Knead** – When a shaggy dough forms, turn it onto a lightly floured surface. Knead **8‑10 minutes** until smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky. If it feels too dry, add a teaspoon of warm water at a time; if too sticky, sprinkle a little extra flour.  
4. **Rest** – Shape the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and let it rest **30 minutes** at room temperature. This relaxes gluten and makes shaping easier.

### 2️⃣ Prepare the ragù  

1. **Sauté the soffritto** – Heat olive oil in the Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and the onion is translucent (≈ 8 min). Add the garlic and cook another 30 seconds.  
2. **Brown the meat** – Increase heat to medium‑high. Add the pancetta, ground pork, and beef. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon. Brown, stirring, until the mixture loses its pink color and develops a deep caramelized crust (≈ 10 min).  
3. **Deglaze** – Pour in the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the pan. Let it reduce by half (≈ 3‑4 min).  
4. **Add tomatoes** – Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaf, oregano, thyme, and pepper. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a **low simmer**.  
5. **Slow cook** – Partially cover the pot (leaving a small vent) and let the sauce simmer **2 – 2½ hours**, stirring every 15‑20 min. If the sauce thickens too much, add a splash of warm water. Season with salt after the first hour (taste, then adjust). Add the rosemary sprig for the last 30 min, if using.  

> **Flavor tip:** A splash (≈ ½ Tbsp) of **balsamic vinegar** or a pinch of **cocoa powder** midway through simmering deepens the ragù’s umami.

### 3️⃣ Shape the pici  

1. **Divide the dough** – After resting, cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the pieces you’re not working with covered to prevent drying.  
2. **Roll each piece** – On a floured surface, roll each piece into a **long, thin rope** about **1 cm (½ in) thick**.  
3. **Form the pici** – Using both hands, pinch the rope together and roll it back and forth across the work surface, applying gentle pressure. The motion stretches the rope into an irregular, slightly thick “cable” that tapers at the ends—this is the classic pici shape.  
4. **Set aside** – Dust each strand lightly with flour and place them on a clean kitchen towel; repeat with the remaining pieces.  

> **Shortcut:** If you’re short on time, you can shape the pici into long, 2 cm (¾‑in) thick strands and cut them into 20‑cm (8‑in) lengths, then roll them individually. The texture will still be wonderful.

### 4️⃣ Cook the pici  

1. **Boil** – Bring a large pot of heavily salted water (≈ 1 Tbsp salt per litre) to a rolling boil. Add the pici in batches; they’re thick, so **cook 10‑12 minutes** until al dente (they should float and have a tender bite).  
2. **Reserve pasta water** – Scoop out ½ cup of the starchy cooking water before draining.  
3. **Drain** – Toss the cooked pici into the ragù, stirring gently to coat. Add a splash of reserved water if the sauce needs loosening.  

### 5️⃣ Plate & Serve  

1. **Twirl** – Using tongs, twirl a handful of pici onto a warm plate, letting the ragù cascade over the strands.  
2. **Finish** – Sprinkle generously with **grated Pecorino Romano** and a pinch of freshly cracked black pepper. Add a scatter of chopped parsley or basil for color.  
3. **Optional drizzle** – A thin drizzle of **extra‑virgin olive oil** (preferably cold‑pressed) adds a silky finish.

## SERVING SUGGESTIONS  

| Pairing | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Wine** | Chianti Classico, Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, or a Brunello di Montalcino (medium‑full body, bright acidity) |
| **Side** | A simple Tuscan bean salad (cannellini, red onion, rosemary, olive oil) or roasted seasonal vegetables |
| **Bread** | Rustic Tuscan “pane toscano” or a crusty sourdough for mopping up sauce |
| **Dessert** | Cantucci with Vin Santo or a light lemon ricotta cake |

## VARIATIONS & TIPS  

| Variation | How to adapt |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Wild boar ragù** | Substitute 250 g ground wild boar for half the pork; add a pinch of juniper berries and a splash of dry marsala. |
| **Spicy kick** | Add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes with the aromatics. |
| **Vegetarian** | Omit meat; replace with a mixture of finely chopped mushrooms, lentils (½ cup cooked), and smoked paprika. Cook as usual, extending simmer time for depth. |
| **Gluten‑free** | Use 100 % gluten‑free “00” style flour blend; handle the dough gently as it will be more fragile. |
| **Make‑ahead ragù** | Prepare ragù a day ahead; it improves with time. Reheat gently over low heat, adding a splash of water if needed. |
| **Freezer‑ready pici** | After shaping, lay the strands on a parchment‑lined tray, freeze solid, then transfer to a zip‑top bag. Boil directly from frozen (add a minute or two). |

## STORAGE  

| Item | Refrigerator | Freezer |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Fresh pici (un‑cooked)** | Up to 24 h on a floured tray, covered with a damp cloth. | Up to 2 months (see “Freezer‑ready pici” tip) |
| **Ragù** | 3‑4 days in an airtight container. | 3 months; reheat slowly, adding water if too thick. |
| **Leftover pasta + sauce** | Best consumed within 2 days; reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of stock or water. |

## QUICK RECAP (THE “CHEAT‑SHEET”)  

1. **Dough:** 400 g flour + 2 eggs + salt → knead 8 min → rest 30 min.  
2. **Ragù:** Sofrito → brown meat → deglaze w/ wine → add tomatoes & herbs → simmer 2 – 2½ h.  
3. **Shape:** Roll dough into thick ropes, hand‑roll into tapering cables.  
4. **Cook:** Boil pici 10‑12 min → combine with ragù, finish with Pecorino.  

Enjoy the rustic, comforting marriage of thick, chewy pici and a slow‑cooked, fragrant ragù—just like you’d find in a trattoria in the Tuscan hills! Buon appetito!
