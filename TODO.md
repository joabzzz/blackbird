### Chat
* We have the white shimmer for processing. I'd like to see what it looks like if the shimmer is our trademark blaze orange (I think its #ff3509)

### Docs
* When I click on a doc, it should open it up to be read!

### Settings
* Can we have an "Octane" display setting mode its like Light but the background is the classic blaze orange #ff3509. So to imagine, blaze orange background, black text, borders etc. For parts that were accented orange before, they can be white in Octane mode. Processing shimmer is white.
